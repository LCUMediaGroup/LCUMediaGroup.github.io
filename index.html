		<p>	Following the decline of YELLOWHOUSEPRODUCTIONS, it became abundantly clear that the stage was set for a new face in mixed media entertainment. That’s where LCUMG founder Vicktor Pargas came into the equation. Pargas utilized this new space to launch the Lapto Cinematic Universe(LCU), a mixed media continuity focused on telling stories of life and death, love and war, and corruption and innocence.</p>
<p>	Vicktor Pargas, an aspiring filmmaker, began the LCU by pulling together inspiration from crime and political drama, arthouse cinema, and video-gaming culture. Pargas set out on his venture by recruiting - at the time - novice actors Adam Logan, Jonathan Ponce, and D▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓TO to star in his first LCU films. The rest, of course, was history, as these initial short films would launch the property’s creator, and actors, to large mainstream success.</p>
<p>	Not long after the beginning of the LCU’s explosive success, Vicktor Pargas formed the LCU Media Group, a conglomerate intended on furthering the LCU story, as well as stories like it. Today, the LCUMG is responsible for producing much of the entertainment that Americans consume on a daily basis through its various film and television studios, video game development studios, and other entertainment businesses.</p>
<p>	The LCU story is, undoubtedly, an inspiring one. Igniting passion and inspiration in many young film makers and creators to this day. We hope you enjoyed this brief look into our story and history, and we hope you stick around and explore all our LCU Media Group hub site has to offer!
